# Classification Of Time Series Using RNN
This project is part of the exam of Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course at Politecnico
di Milano, and it corresponds to the second challenge. The aim of the project is to classify samples in
the multivariate time series format. In other words, since this is a classification problem, the objective
is to correctly map the information contained in the features calculated over time to their labels.


The project will describe the data exploration and preprocessing steps in order to prepare and understand
the data, and the implementation of the classification using several approaches: RNN, LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, 1DConv, Feedforward Neural Networks, GRU, LSTM-
1DConv.

It is possible to check all the details of the project from the pdf in this repository, together with the notebooks of the models.
